    <p><strong>The last time I used HTML was 12 years ago, in high school, we did some work
       with HTML in our computers course. Over the span of high school I utilized HTML to make my MySpace unique. HTML allowed me
      to customize the font, size, and color of lettering on my MySpace page as well as insert
      custom backgrounds.</strong></p>
